wixmedia-python SDK
===================

This library allows you to upload files and perform various manipulations on uploaded images. 
These manipulations include, but are not limited to, resizing, cropping, rotating, sharpening, watermarking, face-detection and applying numerous filters. 
This functionality eliminates the need for offline processing in order to optimize images for web development. 
The resulting files are saved for later usage, so image processing occurs only once per each permutation.
